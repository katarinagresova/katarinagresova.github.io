          Working as a Research Specialist in Panagiotis Alexiou Research Group.

          As a PhD student, my research journey has been driven by a passion for staying at the forefront of genomics and machine learning advancements, particularly in the domain of miRNA targeting and deep learning. A notable accomplishment during my doctoral studies was the development of a robust deep learning model for precise classification of miRNA targets, leveraging CLASH data. This achievement required extensive effort in both model development and interpretation, leading to novel biological insights learned by the model. Furthermore, I have actively contributed to the field by curating and collecting diverse genomic datasets, facilitating the development and benchmarking of machine and deep learning models. These datasets serve as invaluable resources for researchers in their pursuit of advancing the field of genomics through the power of artificial intelligence.

          Recently, deep neural networks have been successfully applied in many biological fields. 
          In 2020, a deep learning model AlphaFold won the protein folding competition with predicted structures within the error tolerance of experimental methods. 
          However, this solution of the most prominent bioinformatic challenge of the past 50 year has been possible only thanks to a carefully curated benchmark of experimentally predicted protein structures. 
          In Genomics, we have similar challenges (annotation of genomes and identification of functional elements) but currently we lack benchmarks similar to protein folding competition. 
          Therefore, we propose a collection of benchmark datasets for the classification of genomic sequences with the emphasis on transparency, reproducibility, comparativeness and ease of use. 
          The datasets are open source and the process of their creation is fully documented. 
          We provide an interface for most commonly used deep learning libraries, implementation of the simple neural network and a training framework that can be used as a starting point for future research. 
          We believe that this work will reduce the overhead of researchers that want to apply their machine learning knowledge to the field of Genomics and it will create a healthy competition leading to new discoveries.
